# Summarizing-Clustered-Text
Description: The goal of this project is to summarize large amount of text in order to gain fast and useful insights
from the text without reading the entire text which is time consuming and not feasible in many
situations.TextRank algorithm has been used for summarizing the text. TextRank is an extractive
and unsupervised text summariation technique that is derived from PageRank algorithm and is used
for generating a concise and meaningful summary of the text from multiple text resources.It assigns
a pagerank score to each sentence in the text and top ranked sentences become the final summary.
